This is a simple and funny game that I've ever made. Your goal is to play against the computer and achieve a total score of 100.
The user needs to input either of these three options (r, p, s) OR (R, P, S) pressing any key other than this will warn the player to enter the provided options. The player can quit the game by simply pressing 'q' OR 'Q'.
And also display the winner either the computer or human by comparing the scores of both.
