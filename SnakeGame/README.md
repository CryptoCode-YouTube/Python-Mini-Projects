In this tutorial you will learn how to build the game snake.  The game is an arcade game and it has very simple logic, which is why it is an ideal example to demonstrate how to build games with Pygame.

The player is represented as snake, which grows if it eats an apple. The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding into yourself.  This is very easy in the early phase of the game but is increasingly more difficult as the length of the snake grows.

The main package I've been used here is Pygame

#### `pip install pygame`
will install the pygame module and try the code!
